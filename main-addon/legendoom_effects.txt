[GB] GunBonsai Upgrade
[] Pending
[*] Done or Similarly Implmented
[?] Needs investigation/Maybe
[.] Perhaps Later
[!] Needs framework implementation

HSFW: Hitscan Framework
PDFW: Projectile Detection Framework
MSFW: Map Start Framework
StFW: Stacking Framework

Note 1: Instead of being forced to implement HSFW+PDFW, we could just have a
	counter that detects the last time OnDamageDealt was triggered. Player could
	still technically fire their weapon so long as they don't do damage of
	course, but it's a start.
Note 2: Might be able to implement a feature in HSFW that collects information about
	the HSs and work from that. Would require HSFW.

To Implement
------------
[] Violent "Enemies gib, damaging and scaring nearby enemies\n\n\ci''Haha, what a mess...''";
[] Raging "Damage is tripled while berserk is active";
[] Unknown "Has unlimited ammo while invisibility is active";
	Implement by adding InfiniteAmmo powerup.
[] Pristine "While at 100+ health, does double damage\n\n\ci''*Guncaster Secret Sound*''";
[] AntiAir "Attacks do triple damage to aerial monsters\n\crLOST SOUL \ccI\cr CACODEMON \ccI\cr PAIN ELEMENTAL\c-\n\n\ci''CACO SEASON''";
[] Berserker "Does more damage the lower your health is\n\n\ci''[insert doom comic quote here]''";
[] WarmUp "Killing five enemies on the level gives you berserk";
[] Nuclear "Does less damage, has infinite ammo";
[] Desperate "When attacking below 26% health, gives moments of invincibility";
[] Accelerator "Fires instant hitting attacks";
[] Vampiric "Attacks drain life from enemies";
[] Scavenging "Attacks give you armor from enemies";
[] Spamtastic "Projectiles rapidly fire smaller projectiles randomly";
[] Hopeful "Killing an enemy while below 33% health restores you to 33%";
[] Intimidating "Invulnerability also gives you damage and fright effects\n\ch[PASSIVE]";
[] Ghostly "Invisibility gives 90% damage resistance and AOE immunity\n\ch[PASSIVE]";
[] Heroic "Attacks do triple damage to bosses\n\crCYBERDEMON \ccI\cr SPIDER MASTERMIND\c-\n\n\ci''That's gotta be worth like, 5 EXPs''";
	Unlike other similar upgrades, this one can actually work, as we can detect the boss flag.
[] Champion "Berserks give an additional five extra powerups\n\ch[PASSIVE]   \ct[STACKS]\n\n\ci''Berserk, now with added vitamins and minerals!''";
[] Vacuum "Projectiles pull in enemies as they travel";
[] Painful "Attacks always flinch enemies\n\n\ci''That's gotta hurt!''";
	?: Not sure how it works.
	: Uses FORCEPAIN flag on puff:
	ACTOR LDPainfulBulletPuff : LDBulletPuff
	{
	   +FORCEPAIN
	}
	Can probalby just spawn a puff on damage via HE Shots logic, might not work for 0 damage attacks
[] Mysterious "It is a mystery";
	?: Don't know what this does.
	: Projectile only, projectiles jump around randomly, between 2 and 12 tics between warps:
    TNT1 A 0 A_Warp (AAPTR_DEFAULT, frandom(-32.0,32.0),frandom(-32.0,32.0),frandom(-32.0,32.0), frandom(0.0,360.0))
	Inventory item that triggers.
[] Concentrating "Projectiles increase in damage the longer they fly";
	?: Should be doable, but dunno if I want to.
	: Could use GetAge as a counter, reading it in OnDamageDealt to trigger extra damage
[] Decaying "Extreme damage randomization\n\n\ci''The DM says to use D100s.''";
	?: Maybe? Could do a +/-X% on damage. Need to see how it's implemented.
	: Seems like the randomization is min 1, max dmg x2
[] Irradiated "Fires radiation pulses that do AOE damage constantly\n\n\ci''If you think this is bad,\n\ciyou should see my cellphone''";
	?: Seems similar to HE Shots?
	: Projectile does dmg x rnd(1, 8) AoE dmg (Radius 256:256) every 18 tics, emitting "rad" particles periodically 

Implement Later
---------------
[.] Crippling "Attacks give the enemy a 50% damage debuff\n\n\ci''Vault Boy Approved!''";
	?: Check implementation, otherwise seems doable.
	.: Just gives the monster a powerup:
	actor LDCripplingDebuff : PowerDamage
	{
	  Powerup.Duration -8
	  DamageFactor "Normal", 0.5
	  Inventory.Icon ""
	}
[.] Artifact "Gain a random powerup on kill every 30 seconds\n\n\ci''It's not a pulsing heart-thing, but it's close!''";
	?: Should work, need to investigate.
	?: Requires StFW (Does it?).
	.: Very complicated the way it's implemented, but I could probably do it
[.] Raycaster "Rockets emit BFG rays\n\n\ci''No, this doesn't add pushwalls.''";
	?: Could work with all projectiles
	.: Can probably be done with inv items, proj only, but would be a bit complicated
[.] ColdBlooded "Damage starts off at Berserk levels, Berserk reduces it";
	Interesting idea, but I want to focus on purely positive upgrades
[.] Trailblazing "Fires faster the lower your health is";
	Can be easily done, but not that interesting to me
[.] Scanner "Computer maps give tracking map\n\ch[PASSIVE]";
	Not interesting to me.
[.] Heavy "Greatly increased knockback\n\n\ci''Kickback and relax.''";
	Tried this, kinda worked, but TF is also looking into this
[.] Hunting "Slower firerate, but higher damage and knockback";
	Defintely able to do, but the knockback implementation is an issue
